## Session Summaries

### 001 — Build Recovery + Session Memory Baseline (2026-05-21)
Session 001 established project context docs, audited build failures, applied the requested source-level compatibility fixes, and verified a successful end-to-end `make clean && make firmware` build in the active repository. Session closeout added the first formal handoff log and a full MEMORY baseline for subsequent sessions.
- **Find here**: build failure root cause, A/B fix groups, toolchain requirements draft, repository-path mismatch lesson, successful firmware image output

### 002 — Temp Pattern Parameter Isolation + Morph Move Prep (2026-05-29 to 2026-06-01)
Session 002 completed encoder work, restored the `.ALL` / `.PRF` load and parameter-pushback baseline, then advanced the temporary-pattern model: symmetric normal/temp `SeqKitState` storage, kit/front and morph parameter endpoint capture, three resolved automation-target images per kit, normal-only file-load routing, lazy temp initialization, per-track endpoint sync, low-CC offset fixes, endpoint/menu restore chirp isolation, queued/rate-limited endpoint restore, and the audit plan for moving morph computation fully onto STM.
- **Find here**: encoder completion, comms/load checkpoint, restore handshake, +1/-1 parameter offset, SEQ16 temp pattern, symmetric `SeqKitState`, endpoint dump/copy-to-temp, automation target image storage, normal-only file loads, temp edit isolation, per-track temp/normal endpoint sync, endpoint restore chirp, rate-limited restore, AVR morph-state audit, STM morph move plan

### 003 — STM-Owned Morph Move + Post-Morph Temp Cache Handoff (2026-06-03)
Session 003 moved standard morph computation fully onto STM: STM now owns global/per-voice morph state, one-parameter-per-main-loop interpolation, live DSP morph application, LFO/velocity modulation of voice morph, raw endpoint-index storage, automation-target image refresh, and the live-apply cache needed for zero-valued file parameters to land in DSP. The session also removed per-parameter valid arrays from `SeqKitState`; sound parameter arrays are always-defined from zero init, file loads write normal endpoint arrays only, and the morph worker is the only intended writer of interpolation arrays. Standard morph was hardware-confirmed, but the normal/temporary pattern and parameter exchange is broken after the move and is the recommended Session 004 goal.
- **Find here**: STM-owned morph, per-voice morph, global morph command, raw endpoint indexing, automation target sidebands, LFO target to voice morph, valid-array removal, file-load endpoint-to-DSP flow, live-apply cache, zero-valued parameter apply bug, waveform Drum 2 fix, temp exchange broken, SEQ16 temp cache observation bodge, post-morph Session 004 audit plan

### 004 — Temp Background Loading Stabilization + Morph/Automation Repair (2026-06-07)
Session 004 made the post-morph temp/background-load model functional: copy-to-temp became an STM-side pattern/parameter snapshot, switching normal/temp became source selection rather than staging, AVR endpoint restore now keeps the menu synced on boundaries, legacy load hold/cache paths were neutralized for temp loading, the retrigger-like glitch was removed by rebuilding the live-apply path, LFO target assignments to voice morph now survive normal/temp switches, velocity-to-morph is a trigger-time one-shot, and LFO-to-morph is serviced by a phased morph drain so only one interpolation/apply runs per STM main-loop pass. Session 004 also identified the future `/Preset/` refactor boundary and created canonical refactor/comms knowledge for Session 006/007.
- **Find here**: STM-only copy-to-temp, normal/temp source switching, endpoint push-up/menu sync, first-switch freeze removal, sequence LED restore after load, retrigger glitch diagnostics/fix, raw selector vs resolved automation target coherence, LFO/velocity target to voice morph, phased morph drain, AVR temp buffer naming, preset/morph refactor plan, UART/protocol redundancy notes

### 005 — Global Morph Menu Sync Closeout + Audit Cleanup (2026-06-09)
Session 005 closed the remaining global morph menu-sync bug after the reset: STM now reports the selected kit image's `globalMorphAmount` back to AVR only on actual normal/temp boundary restores, and AVR updates menu state without echoing the change back into STM sound state. The session kept the scope narrow, documented the fix in the session logs, and left the broader preset/background-load refactor for later.
- **Find here**: display-only global morph report opcodes, normal/temp boundary restore behavior, AVR menu update without STM echo, session 005 closeout logs and audit notes

### 006 — Refactor Planning + Phased Roadmap Finalization (2026-06-09)
Session 006 finalized the comprehensive phased refactor plan for the STM-side preset, morph, and pattern subsystems. Key decisions were made to unify background loading into a single overwriteable session model, retire legacy voice-cache promotion paths, and strictly separate UART transport from protocol parsing. The resulting roadmap served as the authoritative guide for the upcoming implementation phases.
- **Find here**: refactor phased roadmap, module boundaries for `/Preset/` and `/uARTFrontSYX/`, single background-load session model, transport vs protocol separation decisions, retired legacy load paths

### 007 — Refactor Phase 1: Core Preset Module Carve-out (2026-06-09)
Session 007 implemented Phase 1 of the architectural refactor. It established the new `mainboard/LxrStm32/src/Preset/` directory and moved the core sound-state structures (`SeqKitState`), parameter mapping logic, and ingress authority into `KitState`, `ParameterMap`, and `ParameterIngress` modules. `Sequencer` remains a compatibility façade for this phase, while `MidiParser` and `frontPanelParser` were migrated to use the new `preset_*` ingress APIs directly. Extensive documentation was added to all new and moved code to ensure ownership and intent are clear for future phases.
- **Find here**: Preset module structure, KitState ownership, ParameterMap resolution, ParameterIngress authority, sequencer compatibility façade, deep comment requirements

### 008 — AVR Startup Substep Toggle Bug Fix (2026-06-09)
Session 008 identified and fixed a bug where the AVR would incorrectly toggle all substeps of the first pattern's first step on startup. The root cause was a mismatch between the software button-state mirror (initialized to 'all pressed') and the actual hardware state (all released), combined with a polling order that processed SELECT buttons before the SHIFT button. This resulted in a phantom "shifted release" event on the first scan. The fix involved synchronizing the software mirror with the hardware state in `din_init()` before the main loop begins.
- **Find here**: AVR startup bug, DIN initialization, button-state mirror synchronization, phantom release events, polling order dependency, hardware/software state alignment

### 009 — Refactor Phase 2: Morph Engine and Live-Apply (2026-06-10)
Session 009 implemented Phase 2 of the architectural refactor. The morph engine, interpolation worker, phased LFO-to-morph drain, and live-apply suppression cache were moved into the new `mainboard/LxrStm32/src/Preset/MorphEngine` module. All relocated logic was renamed with the `preset_` prefix. A new authoritative DSP application bridge, `preset_applySingleParameterValue()`, was established in `ParameterIngress.c`. The `sequencer.h` header was updated with compatibility wrappers to ensure the rest of the codebase remains functional during the transition.
- **Find here**: Morph engine relocation, interpolation worker, live-apply cache, phased morph drain, DSP application bridge, preset API renaming, sequencer compatibility wrappers

### 010 — Refactor Phase 3: Endpoint Restore, Temp Switching, and Background-Load Finalizer (2026-06-11)
Session 010 completed the Phase 3 ownership split. Endpoint restore policy moved into `Preset/EndpointRestore`, temp/normal source selection and switch state moved into `Preset/TempPlaybackSwitch`, and the PRF/background-load cache moved into `Preset/PresetLoadCache`. The parser now imports the new cache API directly, including the pending-counter reset helper, and the Phase 3 build was verified with `make stm32 -j4`.
- **Find here**: Endpoint restore ownership, temp-switch state split, background-load session cache, parser-to-PresetLoadCache wiring, pending-counter reset helper, build verification

### 011 — Refactor Phase 4: Pattern Ownership and Generator Relocation (2026-06-12)
Session 011 completed Phase 4 of the architectural refactor. Pattern storage and mutation now live in `Sequencer/Pattern/PatternData.c/.h`, the Euclid/SOM generator files were moved under the same directory, and `sequencer.c` was trimmed back to the real-time scheduler/trigger role while retaining the compatibility façade in `sequencer.h`. Build wiring was updated for the new pattern submodule and the firmware build remained green after the move.
- **Find here**: PatternData ownership, pattern copy/clear/mutation helpers, Euclid/SOM generator relocation, sequencer façade trim, build wiring, stale dependency cleanup

### 012 — Refactor Phase 5: Front-Panel Transport/Protocol Relocation (2026-06-12)
Session 012 completed the Phase 5 front-panel transport/protocol split. The front-panel UART transport and parser now live under `uARTFrontSYX/`, the opcode namespace moved into `FrontPanelProtocol.h` behind a compatibility include from `MidiMessages.h`, and the build remained green after the move. The session also smoke-tested `.ALL` load, morph, parameter change, copy to temp, load new `.ALL`, and switch-back flow; MIDI-specific verification remains for later. `PresetLoadCache` continues to own PRF/background-load session state, while the remaining legacy hold/unhold cleanup is deferred to the next phase.
- **Find here**: front-panel UART transport relocation, parser relocation, opcode namespace split, compatibility include, build wiring, hardware smoke test, next-phase legacy cleanup

### 013 — Session 013 Closeout: Phase 6 Completion and Phase 7 Handoff (2026-06-13)
Session 013 closed out the Phase 6 cleanup/naming pass and then turned the refactor into its next-phase handoff. The remaining useful material from the old refactor docs was migrated into the new Phase 7+ consolidation audit plus the two session-in-flight specs for UART comms and temporary/pattern/parameter load behavior. Session 013 also wrote the detailed handoff log, updated the session index, and refreshed MEMORY so the next session can start from the new canonical docs instead of the retired planning files.
- **Find here**: Phase 6 closeout, `PRESET_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT.md`, `COMMS_FLOW_SPEC.md`, `TEMPORARY_PAT_PARAM_LOAD_SPEC.md`, handoff log and index updates, retired planning-doc cleanup

### 014 — Session 014: Phase 7 Shared-Module Removal (2026-06-13)
Session 014 finished the Phase 7 shared-module removal. `Sequencer`, `MidiParser`, and `MidiVoiceControl` now read live voice, pattern, and morph state directly from the owning modules, `presetLoad_finalizeTempBackgroundLoad()` stays on the `TempPlaybackSwitch`-facing interface so `sequencer.c` no longer needs the old cache header, and `PresetLoadCache.c/.h` were deleted in favor of the parser-local transitional bridge inside `frontPanelParser.c`. The code still has one remaining parser-local holdover to retire in the follow-on consolidation work, but the shared cache module itself is gone and the build is green.
- **Find here**: direct owner reads, live pattern/morph cutover, `TempPlaybackSwitch` finalizer interface, parser-local transitional bridge, shared cache deletion, build verified

### 015 — AVR Encoder Timer1 Compare Cutover + API Pruning (2026-06-13)
Session 015 closed the AVR front-panel encoder follow-up by replacing the fragile stable-driver experiment with Timer1 compare polling, removing the dead 2-step encoder surface, and making the 4-step reader direction-aware again. The user re-tested the hardware, confirmed it works, and accepted the remaining rough feel on reversals and fast spins so the encoder work could be parked for now.
- **Find here**: Timer1 compare encoder path, dead 2-step API removal, direction-aware detent accumulator, hardware re-test, log/memory refresh

### 016 — AVR Encoder Fixed-Rest FSM Finalization (2026-06-13)
Session 016 completed the main encoder stabilization. The final AVR encoder path exposes only `encode_stableRead4()` for rotation, removes legacy/selectable read modes, samples PC0/PC1/PC2 from `TIMER1_COMPA_vect` at 16 kHz, and emits detents only after a legal sequence leaves and returns to the fixed hardware rest phase `AB=11`. Temporary boot LCD diagnostics identified the true rest phase and were removed after the user confirmed the final behavior works well on hardware.
- **Find here**: final Timer1 16 kHz encoder FSM, fixed `ENCODER_REST_STATE = 0x03`, `encode_stableRead4()`-only API, removed debug hooks, hardware-approved encoder behavior, updated hardware archive

### 017 — Preset Rename Completion + UART Send Split Mapping (2026-06-14)
Session 017 completed the remaining Preset-owned rename sweep, removed the last Preset-specific `seq_` aliases, and confirmed that the remaining Sequencer lookup helpers are orchestration rather than missed ownership split points. The session also expanded the comms audit so the outbound front-panel transmit work is clearly mapped to the future `frontPanelSendingProtocol` split, and refreshed the temporary load/spec docs so the permanent reference material carries the useful planning notes.
- **Find here**: `PresetKitState` / `PresetAutomationTargets` rename, `PresetEndpointRestoreRequest`, temp-switch alias removal, `sequencer.h` compatibility cleanup, Phase 12 retrospective, direct front-panel send inventory, `frontPanelSendingProtocol` planning, comms/temp spec refresh

### 018 — UART Send/Receive Split Implementation (2026-06-14)
Session 018 implemented the current comms split pass: the front-panel send helpers were consolidated behind `frontPanelSendingProtocol`, the MIDI parser was divided into channel and global ownership files, and the transitional front-panel load/session bridge moved out of `frontPanelParser.c` into `PresetLoadCache`. The parser, sequencer, restore, and voice-control call sites were rewired to the new helpers, and the user re-tested the most important front-panel and MIDI paths with no regressions reported.
- **Find here**: `PresetLoadCache` bridge extraction, `frontPanelSendingProtocol` helper expansion, `ChannelMidiParser` and `GlobalMidiParser` split, `frontPanelParser` receive ownership, `MidiVoiceControl` LED delegation, restore/send call site rewiring, build verification, front-panel/MIDI smoke tests

### 019 — AVR Encoder Retune and Edit Acceleration (2026-06-14)
Session 019 re-examined the AVR main encoder after slow counter-clockwise clicks again missed decrements. The audit found no post-Session-016 AVR source regression, then tuned the Timer1 sampler to about 32.05 kHz with six stable phase samples, kept fixed `AB=11` rest anchoring, added a narrow recovery for filtered rest-to-opposite contact jumps, doubled button debounce enough to stop encoder-switch double clicks, and added config-driven edit-mode acceleration based on complete emitted detents. The final hardware test was reported good, with `ENC_ACCEL_MAX_MULT` set to 4 and endpoint clamp handling fixed so accelerated downward edits land cleanly on zero.
- **Find here**: current AVR encoder timing, six-sample phase filter, `AB=11` rest-FSM preservation, rest-jump recovery, 192-sample button debounce, edit-mode-only acceleration, acceleration config defines, endpoint clamp fix, hardware archive refresh

### 020 — Refactor Finalization: Cache Removal and Protocol Split Closeout (2026-06-14)
Session 020 reconciled the stale preset and MIDI/UART audits with the actual code, then finished the remaining architecture objectives. The recreated `PresetLoadCache.c/.h` from Session 018 was removed as obsolete rather than rehomed, active `presetLoad_*` cache APIs were removed, file-load receive paths now write directly to normal Preset/Pattern storage, and normal/temp Preset/Pattern switching remains the only staging model. STM receive code was renamed to `uARTFrontSYX/frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c/.h`, AVR protocol code was split into `frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c/.h` and `frontPanelSendingProtocol.c/.h`, and the old parser/protocol shim headers were removed after include/project redirection. A final cleanup moved the internal CC/CC2 parameter-apply ladder from `MIDI/MidiParser.c` to `uARTFrontSYX/frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c`, renamed front-panel command receive state away from `frontParser_midiMsg`, renamed `MidiVoiceControl.c/.h` to `MidiOutputControl.c/.h`, and moved Sequencer MIDI fan-out behind `outputControl_*`. STM, AVR, and aggregate firmware builds were verified, and the user hardware-tested Steps 1-3 successfully.
- **Find here**: `PresetLoadCache` removal, direct normal-storage file loads, STM `frontPanelReceivingProtocol` rename, AVR receive/send protocol split, legacy shim removal, front-panel CC/CC2 apply ownership, `MidiOutputControl` rename, Sequencer MIDI output boundary, deprecated PRF/cache traffic status, superseded audit references, build and hardware verification

### 021 — AVR Comms Rename + Knowledge Pass (2026-06-15)
Session 021 renamed the AVR comms layer into `front/LxrAvr/avrComms/`, updated the live reference docs so AVR uses `avrComms*` and STM keeps `frontPanel*` under `uARTFrontSYX/`, and refreshed `MEMORY.md` plus the session archive to keep the naming split explicit. No firmware behavior changed in this session.
- **Find here**: `avrComms` directory move, AVR naming map, memory update, comms/hardware doc refresh, STM front-panel ownership note

### 022 — Per-Track Temp Copy Cleanup + Sequencer API Documentation (2026-06-16)
Session 022 finished the temp-copy cleanup pass so copy-to-temp now snapshots the actually playing per-track patterns and uses the temp-pattern sentinel rules consistently. It also cleaned up the Pattern layer documentation and naming, expanded the Sequencer header/source comments so exported state and APIs are explained next to the declarations and definitions, removed a stale Sequencer temp-boundary declaration, and verified the STM32 build still passes afterward.
- **Find here**: per-track temp copy behavior, temp-pattern sentinel handling, PatternData/Sequencer documentation cleanup, exported API comments, stale Sequencer declaration removal, build verification

### 023 — AVR Background-Load Menu Rename + Docs Refresh (2026-06-16)
Session 023 replaced the AVR-facing file-load toggle with a 5-state background-load selector named `PAR_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND`, updated the matching menu labels and text table to `TEXT_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND` / `backgroundLoadNames`, and renamed the AVR send opcode alias to `SEQ_LOAD_BACKGROUND` without changing the wire value or STM runtime behavior. The new selector uses the free packed menu slot `MENU_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND = 0`, which keeps the 4-bit menu-ID encoding intact, and the globals file continues to persist the same raw byte value directly in `glo.cfg` / `.cfg` storage. The session also updated the comms reference, session index, and MEMORY so the new background terminology is now the canonical planning language.
- **Find here**: AVR menu rename, 5-state background-load selector, `MENU_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND = 0` packed-menu slot, raw byte `.cfg` compatibility, `SEQ_LOAD_BACKGROUND` alias, STM unchanged, comms/spec refresh, session log closeout

### 024 — Opcode Audit Closeout + Session Handoff Archive (2026-06-17)
Session 024 converted the opcode audit into code changes. The high-confidence stale opcodes in the AVR and STM receive headers were commented out, the cache-family suspects were commented out or wrapped in disabled blocks where they had thin helper bodies, and the live non-cache file-load/background-load path was left intact because it still serves normal `.ALL` / `.PRF` loading. Anything with `cache` in it was treated as a retirement candidate only when it did not belong to the active non-cache file-load/session path.
- **Find here**: commented-out opcode constants, deprecated PRF cache helper stubs, cache-family suspect list, preserved non-cache file-load/session path, session-log handoff archive

### 025 — Macro Removal Deactivation + Documentation Handoff (2026-06-17)
Session 025 disabled the remaining macro loading and application paths end-to-end. AVR file loads now force the legacy macro slots to zero before they reach live state, the AVR menu code keeps the old macro branches only as commented-out legacy context, the STM front-panel receive path ignores `MACRO_CC` and macro-amount traffic, and the remaining Preset macro storage/replay helpers are inert. The session also added breadcrumb comments at the AVR parameter/menu-text sites and the STM Preset storage sites, then promoted the implementation audit into a permanent handoff log so the temporary audit file can be deleted.
- **Find here**: file-load macro zeroing, AVR menu macro send/apply disable blocks, STM macro receive/apply disable blocks, inert Preset macro storage/replay helpers, legacy parameter/menu-text breadcrumbs, comms spec refresh, MEMORY refresh, build verification

### 026 — PERF Voice Morph Controls + Encoder List Findings (2026-06-18)
Session 026 brought the existing PERF-page individual voice morph controls online for Drum 1-3, Snare, Cym, and Hihat. AVR edits now use full `0..255` values and dedicated low/high `VOICE_MORPH` traffic, STM applies those values as current per-voice morph state for the morph worker, global morph remains authoritative and syncs all six voice display slots, and MIDI CC1 plus trigger-time velocity voice morph updates now report full-range display values back to AVR. The LFO morph overlay model was preserved unchanged. The late encoder `DTYPE_MENU` list mismatch investigation did not produce a valid fix; the bad attempts were reverted and the useful findings were written to `ENC_LIST_MISMATCH_ERROR.md`.
- **Find here**: PERF voice morph amount transport, per-voice morph display reports, global morph override display sync, MIDI CC1 morph display feedback, trigger-time velocity voice morph, generic velocity VMORPH guard, LFO overlay non-change, unresolved encoder list mismatch trace plan

### 027 — Live-Record Automation Destination + Encoder DTYPE_MENU Fix (2026-06-19)
Session 027 fixed the live-record wrong-parameter bug by making `Step.param1Nr` / `param2Nr` consistently store raw AVR/menu `PAR_*` destinations. Front-panel live recording and manual step-destination edits now both write raw ids, automation playback converts raw ids to the `MIDI_CC` / `CC_2` message shape expected by `frontParser_applyParameterCommand()`, and external MIDI recording uses `seq_recordAutomationMidiDestination()` to convert MIDI-domain ids back to raw storage. The session also resolved the clarified encoder `DTYPE_MENU` issue: encoder edit mode was selecting the correct parameter but clamping menu values to the last item when the stored value was a raw byte, so both encoder edit paths now normalize out-of-range `DTYPE_MENU` values into compact list-index range before applying the encoder delta. A final small patch made encoder press on the SHIFT+COPY clear menu execute the selected clear target instead of falling through to the generic shifted encoder press behavior. The automation and `DTYPE_MENU` fixes were hardware-confirmed by the user.
- **Find here**: raw step automation destination convention, live-record Drum 2 volume fix, automation playback conversion boundary, external MIDI automation helper, step editor raw round-trip, `frontPanelSending_sendParameterEcho()` audit, encoder `DTYPE_MENU` value-domain diagnosis, encoder menu-value normalization, clear menu encoder-press carveout, hardware verification

### 028 — Background File Loading Via Temporary Data Complete (2026-06-21)
Session 028 completed background loading through the existing normal/temporary Pattern and Preset storage model. AVR `.pat` / `.prf` / `.all` loads now optionally start a `SEQ_BACKGROUND_SWAP_BEGIN` / `SEQ_BACKGROUND_SWAP_DONE` handshake (`0x6d/0x6e`) based on the 5-state `PAR_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND` selector, STM copies the currently audible pattern/kit state to temp, forces an immediate switch to `SEQ_TMP_PATTERN`, waits for temp-readiness plus the ACK delay, then lets the ordinary file load write normal storage while temp playback continues. `.pat` background loading is pattern-only and keeps preset parameters normal, current global/per-voice morph amounts survive all file loads, `.prf` / `.all` no longer zero the AVR per-voice morph menu values, repeated loads while already playing temp skip another copy-to-temp, and the AVR UI now hints temp playback with PERF/SELECT LED flashing while disabling `SHIFT+PERF`.
- **Find here**: completed background-load handshake, `0x6d/0x6e` swap ACK, `PAR_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND` policy, STM normal-to-temp copy, force instant temp switch, `.pat` pattern-only temp playback, morph preservation, `END_OF_KIT_PARAMETERS`, repeated-load temp guard, temp-playback LED hint, deprecated load-fast/cache cleanup notes, hardware verification

### 029 — Global MIDI CC/NRPN Table Implementation (2026-06-21)
Session 029 added a separate Global-channel MIDI CC/NRPN implementation while leaving the existing non-global Channel MIDI parser in place. Global-channel CC0 bank change and CC1 morph intentionally keep the existing `ChannelMidiParser.c` behavior; Global-channel CC2-127 now pre-empt overlapping voice-channel assignments and route only through `GlobalMidiParser.c`, where the requested flat CC table and Global-only NRPN selector/data-entry table translate into the existing internal `frontParser_applyParameterCommand()` CC/CC2 apply path. The durable MIDI reference now lives in `knowledge_files/comms_spec_reference/MIDI_TABLE.md`, `COMMS_FLOW_SPEC.md` documents the pre-emption rule, the STM build passed, and the user hardware-tested the new Global parser successfully.
- **Find here**: Global MIDI CC pre-emption, preserved Global CC0/CC1 behavior, separate Global CC2-127 table, Global NRPN CC98/99/6 handling, non-global channel MIDI table, `MIDI_TABLE.md`, build and hardware verification

### 030 — Sample Import Stabilization And Closeout (2026-06-26)
Session 030 completed the sample-handling phase closeout across the earlier Phase 1/2/3 planning docs. STM sample import is now bounded to internal flash sectors 8-11 with metadata/count committed last, imported `SampleInfo` keeps a 12-byte ABI with a loop flag in bit 31, oscillator playback handles long one-shots and loops with dense bounds checks, `/samples` and optional `/loops` import through one-pass SD traversal, invalid files no longer consume silent slots, AVR waits for parsed `SAMPLE_UPLOAD_RESULT` packets instead of raw ACK bytes, and the LCD receives numbered sample/loop progress packets. The temporary phase docs can be deleted after this archive/log/spec/comment pass.
- **Find here**: sample flash bounds, dense sample metadata, `/samples` then `/loops`, one-pass SD traversal, parsed sample upload result/progress protocol, loop flag in `SampleInfo.size`, long-sample oscillator playback, hardware SD ownership notes, temporary phase-doc preservation

### 031 — Sample Import Redo And Display Cleanup (2026-06-28)
Session 031 started with oscillator interpolation planning/experiments, but the durable closeout is the clean reimplementation of the sample-import additions after reverting the experimental work. STM sample import now builds a sorted cached 8.3 WAV-name list per folder, orders `/samples` and `/loops` numerically/alphabetically, sends immediate real one-based progress for the current accepted file, uses larger 128-frame PCM transfer blocks, and sends sample progress/result packets through priority-wait transport. AVR sample upload no longer has a fixed timeout or `Load timeout`; it waits for parsed `SAMPLE_UPLOAD_RESULT` while switching locally to `Writing Flash` dots after progress idles. `COMMS_FLOW_SPEC.md` and `MEMORY.md` were updated; `SAMPLE_LOAD_REDO_AUDIT.md` is superseded by the handoff log.
- **Find here**: sorted cached sample-name import, numerical-alphabetical WAV ordering, immediate current-file progress, final loop number display, larger PCM blocks, reliable sample progress/result packets, no sample-upload timeout, AVR-local `Writing Flash` idle spinner, interpolation carry-forward reminders

### 032 — Oscillator Waveform Interpolation (2026-06-28)
Session 032 finalized the implementation of oscillator waveform interpolation, adding a single dynamically assigned fractional blend slot (`OSC_WAVE_INTERP_MAX_ACTIVE=1`). The front panel `PAR_OSC_WAVE_INTERPOLATION` menu parameter was successfully wired through the AVR-to-STM protocol to toggle this behavior globally. Critical fixes were made to the double-render crossfade blocks in `Oscillator.c` to recalculate `phaseInc` for the target waveform (preventing pitch doubling) and to explicitly write back standard oscillator state like `phase` and `samplePosition` (preventing endless 16-frame looping squeals for samples).
- **Find here**: oscillator waveform interpolation, fractional blend slot, double-render crossfade fixes, `osc_setFreq` target recalculation, state writeback for samples

## Key Cross-Session Facts (quick lookup)

| Topic | Canonical session |
|-------|------------------|
| Header/global-definition and inline-linkage compatibility fixes for modern GCC toolchains | 001 |
| Session memory baseline and directory map bootstrapped | 001 |
| Encoder work completed successfully | 002 |
| `.ALL` / `.PRF` load checkpoint and normal-only file-load routing for temp playback | 002 |
| Comms flow-control checkpoint uses load sessions, quiet mode, and credit-metered globals/voice/meta bursts; old callback waits still need timeouts | 002 |
| SEQ16 temp pattern selector/copy/play, symmetric STM parameter images, and endpoint/menu restore behavior | 002 |
| Morph computation is STM-owned for standard operation; AVR keeps global morph/menu/file endpoint responsibilities only | 003 |
| `SeqKitState` no longer has per-parameter valid arrays; parameter arrays are always-defined sound state from zero init | 003 |
| Endpoint storage uses raw AVR/menu parameter indices; low `+1` only applies when sending ordinary live low CC to STM MIDI/DSP apply | 003 |
| Temp/background `.ALL` / `.PRF` loading can proceed while playback uses temp; normal/temp switching is STM source selection plus AVR endpoint push-up | 004 |
| Raw automation selector bytes and resolved automation target structs must be kept coherent, especially for `FRONT_CC_LFO_TARGET` sidebands | 004 |
| LFO-to-voice-morph is serviced by phased morph drain, not immediate full voice-parameter interpolation from LFO callbacks | 004 |
| Velocity-to-voice-morph is a trigger-time one-shot value set, not a generic modulation-node destination | 004 |
| Future preset/morph refactor target is `mainboard/LxrStm32/src/Preset/`; SEQ16 temp keyhole remains intentionally bodged until after that refactor | 004 |
| Global morph menu sync on normal/temp switch is handled by display-only STM-to-AVR report traffic, not file-load routing | 005 |
| Background loading is unified into a single overwriteable STM-side session model; legacy voice-cache promotion is retired | 006 |
| UART transport (Uart.c) and protocol parsing (frontPanelParser.c) are strictly separated; parser is session-aware but transport-blind | 006 |
| Core sound-state (KitState), parameter mapping, and ingress authority are now owned by the new Preset module | 007 |
| AVR `din_inputData` must be synchronized with hardware in `din_init` to prevent phantom startup events | 008 |
| Morph engine and live-apply logic are now owned by the new Preset/MorphEngine module | 009 |
| Phase 3 background-load/session ownership now lives in Preset/PresetLoadCache; frontPanelParser consumes the cache API and the pending-counter reset helper is exported there | 010 |
| Pattern storage and generators now live in Sequencer/Pattern; sequencer.c is trimmed back to the scheduler/trigger role | 011 |
| Front-panel transport and parser code now live in uARTFrontSYX; opcode namespace is isolated in FrontPanelProtocol.h behind a compatibility include | 012 |
| Phase 6 cleanup/naming is complete; the next refactor step is driven by PRESET_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT.md and the old planning docs are no longer canonical | 013 |
| Session 014 cut Sequencer/MIDI off the shared cache header, deleted the shared PresetLoadCache module, and left the remaining parser/session bridge inside frontPanelParser.c | 014 |
| AVR front-panel encoder uses raw `encode_stableRead4()` detents backed by Timer1 ~32.05 kHz sampling, six-sample phase filtering, fixed `AB=11` rest anchoring, narrow rest-jump recovery, and edit-mode-only acceleration; do not reintroduce legacy read modes, PCINT decoding, or Timer0 encoder sampling | 019 |
| Preset-owned exports/types now use `preset_` / `Preset*`, and the remaining AVR front-panel transmit calls are protocol work for `frontPanelSendingProtocol.c/.h` | 017 |
| Front-panel send helpers are now consolidated under `frontPanelSendingProtocol`, the MIDI parser is split across `ChannelMidiParser` and `GlobalMidiParser`, and the transitional receive load/session cache lives in `PresetLoadCache` | 018 |
| `PresetLoadCache.c/.h` and the active `presetLoad_*` cache API are obsolete and removed; file loads route directly to normal storage, while normal/temp Preset and Pattern switching remains the only staging model | 020 |
| STM and AVR front-panel protocol code now use matching receive/send boundaries: STM `uARTFrontSYX/frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c/.h` plus `frontPanelSendingProtocol.c/.h`, AVR `frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c/.h` plus `frontPanelSendingProtocol.c/.h`; old parser/protocol shim headers were removed after redirection | 020 |
| Internal CC/CC2 parameter application is owned by STM `uARTFrontSYX/frontPanelReceivingProtocol.c` via `frontParser_applyParameterCommand()`; `MIDI/MidiParser.c` parses external DIN/USB MIDI and forwards/apply-calls instead of owning those cases | 020 |
| Sequencer-originated MIDI output now goes through `MIDI/MidiOutputControl.c/.h` `outputControl_*` helpers; old `MidiVoiceControl.c/.h` filenames were retired while existing `voiceControl_*` names stayed intact | 020 |
| AVR comms now live in `front/LxrAvr/avrComms/` with `avrComms*` names, while STM front-panel ownership remains under `mainboard/LxrStm32/src/uARTFrontSYX/` with `frontPanel*` names | 021 |
| Copy-to-temp now snapshots the actually playing per-track pattern sources into temp storage, and the temp-pattern repeat rule is tied to `SEQ_TMP_PATTERN` instead of pending-pattern state | 022 |
| Sequencer exported globals/functions in `sequencer.h` and `sequencer.c` now carry adjacent explanatory comments, and the stale `seq_consumeTmpBoundaryPatternSwitchAck()` declaration was removed from Sequencer | 022 |
| AVR background-load menu control now uses `PAR_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND`, `TEXT_FILE_LOAD_BACKGROUND`, `backgroundLoadNames`, and `SEQ_LOAD_BACKGROUND` while keeping STM behavior and raw `.cfg` byte storage unchanged | 023 |
| Legacy PRF/cache opcode surface is commented out; the live non-cache file-load/session path remains active | 024 |
| Legacy macro file-load/apply path is intentionally disabled; file loads zero macro slots and macro traffic is deprecated/ignored | 025 |
| PERF voice morph controls use full `0..255` dedicated `VOICE_MORPH` traffic; do not route these edits through generic `CC_2` or the 7-bit automation setter | 026 |
| Global morph overrides all six per-voice morph values and must keep the six PERF voice morph display slots synchronized with the global amount | 026 |
| MIDI CC1 morph paths remain 7-bit inputs internally but now report the resulting full `0..255` global/voice morph display values back to AVR | 026 |
| Velocity target "Individual Voice Morph" is trigger-time only: keep `TYPE_UINT8_VMORPH` out of generic velocity modulation nodes and apply the computed current morph amount from `voiceControl_noteOn()` | 026 |
| LFO-to-voice-morph remains an async morph-drain overlay from current target voice morph value to morph endpoint; do not rewrite it as a menu/base-value writer | 026 |
| Step automation destinations in `Step.param1Nr` / `param2Nr` are raw AVR/menu `PAR_*` ids; low `+1` conversion belongs at automation playback/application boundaries, and external MIDI recording must use `seq_recordAutomationMidiDestination()` | 027 |
| Encoder `DTYPE_MENU` edits normalize out-of-range raw byte values into compact menu-list indices before applying encoder delta; do not treat that symptom as a parameter-index mismatch | 027 |
| Background `.pat` / `.prf` / `.all` loading now uses the active `0x6d/0x6e` background-swap handshake plus existing normal/temp Pattern and Preset storage; do not revive the old cache/load-fast model | 028 |
| `.pat` background loading is pattern-only: pattern playback may move to `SEQ_TMP_PATTERN`, but preset parameter source remains normal | 028 |
| File loads must not reset current global morph or per-voice morph amounts; `.prf` / `.all` refresh loaded endpoints through normal storage and live morph apply-cache invalidation | 028 |
| Use `END_OF_KIT_PARAMETERS` for saved kit bytes/dumps; keep `PAR_MORPH_DRUM1..PAR_MORPH_HIHAT` inside `END_OF_SOUND_PARAMETERS` for runtime automation/modulation domains | 028 |
| AVR tracks `preset_backgroundTempPlaybackActive`; while active, PERF LED flashes outside PERF mode, all SELECT LEDs flash in PERF, and `SHIFT+PERF` is disabled | 028 |
| For MIDI CC messages, the configured Global channel pre-empts overlapping voice-channel assignments; Global CC0/CC1 preserve the current bank/morph path, while Global CC2-127 use the separate Global table | 029 |
| Global MIDI NRPN is Global-channel-only after Session 029: CC99/CC98 select the NRPN number and CC6 applies NRPN0-92 through the internal CC2 apply path | 029 |
| The durable complete external MIDI spec table is `knowledge_files/comms_spec_reference/MIDI_TABLE.md` | 029 |
| Sample import writes only STM32 internal flash sectors 8-11; PCM must stay below `SAMPLE_INFO_START_ADDRESS` and the committed sample count is written last | 030 |
| Current sample import order is dense `/samples` one-shots first, then optional `/loops`; invalid/unreadable/too-large WAV candidates must not consume waveform slots | 030 |
| AVR sample import completion waits on parsed `SAMPLE_UPLOAD_RESULT` while processing progress packets; do not restore raw `uart_waitAck()` for this path | 030 |
| `SampleInfo` remains a 12-byte on-flash ABI; bit 31 of `size` is the loop flag and bits 30..0 are int16 frame count | 030 |
| Current imported-sample oscillator playback uses 32-bit `samplePosition`, 17-bit `sampleFraction`, and trigger-time `osc_resetSamplePlayback()` for one-shots/loops | 030 |
| The sample-import SD ownership exception is safe only when AVR releases SPI before `SAMPLE_START_UPLOAD` and STM deinitializes SPI on every import exit | 030 |
| Current sample import uses a sorted cached STM-side 8.3 short-name list per folder; digit runs compare numerically and `_`/`-`/space are separator runs so slot order is deterministic | 031 |
| Sample upload progress packets are immediate real one-based current-file numbers; do not delay progress by one file and do not send `data2 == 0` final markers | 031 |
| AVR sample upload has no fixed timeout or `Load timeout`; it waits for `SAMPLE_UPLOAD_RESULT` and uses a display-only local `Writing Flash` idle spinner after numbered progress goes quiet | 031 |
| STM sample progress/result packets use priority-wait transport because they are sparse user-facing status triples and must not be dropped | 031 |
| Future oscillator waveform interpolation must use `PAR_OSC_WAVE_INTERPOLATION` and apply literally across the full waveform parameter domain, including imported samples/loops/noise/base waves | 031 |
